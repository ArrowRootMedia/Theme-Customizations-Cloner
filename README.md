Theme-Customizations-Cloner
===========================

A WordPress Plugin to help clone Theme Customizations by Arrow Root Media (http://arrowrootmedia.com). 
Coded by Adomas Mazeikis : https://github.com/adomas-mazeikis/

This plugin will allow you to :
- take advantage of WordPress' theme customizaztions
- work on a dev site, and export your theme settings to production
- export all your theme customizations
- import your theme customizations to a new site, child theme, or host

This plugin will only work for WordPress' Theme Customizer :
https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API

We started this plugin while customizing the "Make" theme by ThemeFoundry. 
This particular theme takes advantage of WordPress' theme customizations.

We wanted an easy way to export all the theme customziations we worked on so we could :
- export theme settings from dev to production
- work with a parent theme and export those settings to a child theme

We'd love to know how you're using this. And thanks to @coreymckrill (https://github.com/coreymckrill) at Theme Foundry for getting his eyes on this!
